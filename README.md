## Problem Statement Description:
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is rich in structural and textural information but lacks the intuitive appeal of color, which can provide more comprehensive insights for space borne applications. SAR image colorization using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data. The project aims to develop an innovative solution to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced interpretation and analysis of feature targets. A novel DL model needs to be designed and trained using pairs of SAR and Optical images, minimizing a loss function that captures the difference between predicted and actual color images. The participants are challenged to create a DL system that can accurately predict and apply colors to SAR images, making surface features more distinguishable and interpretable. Challenge: The challenges require innovative approaches in data pre-processing, DL model design, and evaluation methodologies to develop effective and reliable SAR image colorization solutions. Usage: The goal is to improve the usability of SAR data in applications like geological studies and environmental monitoring by providing more intuitive and informative visual representations. Users: Remote Sensing Image Analysts Available Solutions (if Yes, reasons for not using them): Existing Deep Learning models have been proposed and used but their performance is not satisfactory. Desired Outcome: DL based SAR Image Colorization Software
